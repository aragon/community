# Aragon Community Contributor Guidelines  

## Purpose  
The purpose of the aragon/community repo is track to-do tasks related to suggested changes in Aragon community infrastructure.  

Here are examples of the kind of issues that are appropriate for this repo:  

- Suggesting a change to the rules of the Aragon subreddit
- Suggesting the implementation of a new bot in Aragon Chat
- Suggesting a new channel in Aragon Chat 
- Suggesting a new use for the Aragon YouTube channel
- Suggesting we use a new tool instead of something we already use (such as alternative to GitHub)

And other related ideas. Really any change that you can think of that touches the infrastructure that the Aragon community uses to collaborate.

## How to contribute

To make suggestions or propose an idea that you want to work on, create a [new issue](https://github.com/aragon/community/issues) so we can discuss your idea, provide feedback, suggest changes, and point out any similar ideas that others might be working on. You can also create "meta-issues" in this repo to suggest changes to the repo and the community collaboration process itself. Please ensure that your issues and pull requests are well-commented and documented so others can easily understand what you are asking or proposing.

Sometimes GitHub isn't the best place to have nuanced discussion about an issue. So after you create your issue, you can optionally start a thread with the same title as your issue in the Aragon Forum under the [Community](https://research.aragon.org/c/community) category. Put a link to the issue in the first post of the thread with a prompt to start a discussion. Then you can share the link to the forum thread in other places to attract attention to the discussion and draw more people in to help and have a productive conversation, hopefully leading to the resolution of your issue. Once your issue is resolved, both the forum thread and the issue on GitHub can be closed.

## Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of GitHub is required to contribute to this repo. A beginner's guide to contributing to open-source projects on GitHub can be found [here](https://handbook.enspiral.com/guides/github_for_beginners.html). 

You should also be familiar with the history and scope of the Aragon project - or at least the part of the project that you're interested in working on - so you can get started without having to ask too many questions. Although if any clarification is needed, we love questions! You can find information about Aragon in the [Aragon wiki](https://wiki.aragon.one).

## Code of Conduct  
All Aragon community contributors are expected to follow the [Aragon Community Code of Conduct](https://wiki.aragon.one/documentation/Code_of_Conduct/). The code of conduct will change so please review it from time to time for any changes you might have missed. Instructions for reporting violations of the code of conduct can be found at the bottom of the code of conduct document.
