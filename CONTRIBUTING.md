# Aragon Community Contributor Guidelines  

## Purpose  
The purpose of the aragon/community repo is to organize Aragon community contributions in an accessible, collaborative format.  

Here are examples of the kind of contributions that are appropriate for this repo:  

- Organizing a community event in your area  
- Sharing an event that you think members of the project should attend, sponsor, or speak at  
- Creating an infographic that can be used for marketing or education  
- Suggesting new activities that community members should be involved in to promote the project  

To make suggestions or propose an idea that you want to work on, create a [new issue](https://github.com/aragon/community/issues) so we can discuss your idea, provide feedback, suggest changes, and point out any similar ideas that others might be working on. You can also create "meta-issues" in this repo to suggest changes to the repo and community collaboration process itself. Please ensure that your issues and pull requests are well-commented and documented so others can easily understand what you are asking or proposing.

## Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of GitHub and git are required to contribute to projects in the Aragon GitHub repo. A guide to contributing to open-source projects on GitHub can be found [here](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/). You should also be fairly well-versed in the history and scope of the Aragon project so you can hit the ground running without too many questions - although if any clarification is needed, we love questions! Information about the Aragon project can be found in the [Aragon wiki](https://wiki.aragon.one).

## Code of Conduct  
All Aragon community contributors are expected to follow the [Aragon Community Code of Conduct](https://wiki.aragon.one/documentation/Code_of_Conduct/). The code of conduct may change without notice, so be sure to review it from time to time for any changes you might have missed. Instructions for reporting violations of the code of conduct can be found at the bottom of the code of conduct document.
